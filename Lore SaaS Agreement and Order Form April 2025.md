An Order Form will take precedence over any other provision of this Agreement, provided that any conflict or inconsistency between the two will only apply to that specific Order Form.

#### 1.6 Control
Licensor has and will retain sole control over the operation, provision, maintenance, and management of the Services.

#### 1.7 Changes
Licensor reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to make changes to the Services to maintain or enhance the quality or delivery of the Services, competitive strength of the Services, or cost efficiency or performance of the Services, or to comply with applicable law.

### 2. Services Disclaimer
The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the Licensor does **not** deliver clinical or medical care, medical services, or provide medical guidance. The Licensor does **not** prescribe treatments, therapies, or medication. The Licensor may collaborate with third parties to connect third-party technologies to the Licensor's Services for a more seamless user experience.

The Licensor does not accept or hold prepayments for health care services.

### 3. License to Access and Use the Services

#### 3.1 Grant
The Licensor grants the Subscriber a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to access and use the Services during the Term solely for Eligible Users within the United States, subject to this Agreement. All rights in the Services not expressly granted hereunder are reserved to the Licensor.

#### 3.2 Scope
This license is solely for the Subscriber's internal business purposes. The Subscriber may add counts of users by executing a new Order Form.

### 4. Restrictions
Except as expressly permitted under this Agreement, Subscriber shall not: (a) make the Services available to anyone other than Eligible Users; (b) copy, modify or create derivative works or improvements of the Services; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt or attempt to derive or gain access to the source code of the Services; (d) bypass or breach any security or protection used by the Services; (e) input, upload, transmit, or otherwise provide to or through the Services, any information or materials that are unlawful or injurious, or contain, transmit or activate any virus, worm, malware or other malicious computer code; (f) damage, destroy, disrupt, disable, impair, interfere with, or otherwise impede or harm in any manner, the Services or provision of Services to any third party; (g) remove, delete, alter or obscure any trademarks, specifications, documentation, warranties or disclaimers, or any copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property or proprietary rights notices, from any Services or copy thereof; (h) access or use the Services in any manner or for any purpose that violates any applicable law; or (i) access or use the Services beyond the scope of this Agreement and relevant Order Form(s).

### 5. Discretion of the Parties
The Parties will retain full discretion over their respective businesses. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to grant either Party any authority, rights, or permission to dictate the other Party's business decisions. Licensor retains sole and absolute discretion to suspend or otherwise deny any Eligible User's access to or use of all or any part of the Services, without incurring any resulting obligation or liability, including but not limited to situations where an Eligible User is no longer associated with the Subscriber or due to violations of Licensor's Terms of Use, Community Guidelines, and Privacy Policy, which are publicly available on the Licensor's website.

### 6. Compensation
In exchange for the Services to be provided and the licenses granted under this agreement, the Subscriber shall pay the Licensor the fees identified in the applicable Order Form.

### 7. Protection of User Data
The Licensor will collect and process information reflecting an individual Lore User's use of the Services, including content accessed, shared or received ("User Data"). Lore User interactions with LoreBot are treated as private. User Data from LoreBot are: not visible to other Lore Users, not monitored by humans, and always encrypted. The Licensor's social community is treated as a public forum. User Data from the social community will be monitored and moderated by specialized algorithms and escalated to humans, as well as visible to other Lore Users. Licensor will **not** disclose the identity of specific Lore Users or User Data to Subscriber, except if necessary for implementation of Services as specified in the Order Form at the sole discretion of the Licensor. Otherwise, Licensor will provide only aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified summaries or reports to Subscriber. If Licensor receives a government request for User Data, it will first direct the government to contact the User or Subscriber. Licensor will require a valid warrant or equivalent court order before releasing User Data, in response to a government request. Licensor reserves the right to file a formal challenge in court to modify or quash a warrant or order. Upon receipt of a warrant or order, Licensor will notify the Lore User and the Subscriber unless legally prohibited, in which case Licensor will provide notice when permitted. Lore User access to the Services remains subject to the Licensor's Terms of Use, Community Guidelines, and Privacy Policy.

### 8. Security
The Licensor will implement commercially reasonable security measures intended to prevent access to the Services and Licensor's network by unauthorized persons. The Licensor will establish and maintain commercially reasonable safeguards against destruction, loss, or alteration of the Services and/or data that is stored or accessed by the Services. Upon the Licensor's discovery of any security breach, intrusion, or other event giving rise to unauthorized access, destruction, loss, or alteration of the Services or data stored or accessed by the Services, the Licensor shall promptly notify the Subscriber and take commercially reasonable actions to mitigate such event.

The Receiving Party will use the same degree of care as it uses with respect to its own similar information, but no less than a reasonable degree of care to protect the Confidential Information from any unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination, or publication. The Receiving Party shall only use the Confidential Information in furtherance of its performance of its obligations under this Agreement and will not use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any other purpose without prior written approval of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party will not decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer all or any part of the Confidential Information.

#### 12.2 Required Disclosures of Confidential Information
If the Receiving Party is confronted with legal action to disclose Confidential Information received under this Agreement, the Receiving Party will, unless prohibited by law, provide prompt written notice to the Disclosing Party to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or other relief it deems appropriate. If disclosure is nonetheless required, the Receiving Party will limit its disclosure to portions of the Confidential Information that must be disclosed.

#### 12.3 Unauthorized Use or Disclosure of Confidential Information
If the Receiving Party discovers any Confidential Information has been used, disseminated, or accessed in violation of this Agreement, it will immediately notify the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall take all reasonable actions to minimize the impact of the unauthorized use or disclosure, and take necessary steps to prevent further breach of this Agreement.

#### 12.4 Protected Health Information and Data Use
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the provision and use of the Services will involve the disclosure of relevant individually identifiable data, which may include protected health information.

Except for the warranties under Sections 14.1 and 14.2, all Services are provided "as is". The Licensor expressly disclaims all other warranties, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation, all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, and all warranties arising from course of dealing, usage or trade practice.

Neither Party has authority to act, create any duty or obligation, bind or contract, or incur liability in the name of or on account of the other Party. Also, neither Party has authority to make statements, representations, warranties, or commitments on behalf of the other Party.

### 18. Force Majeure
